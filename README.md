This is one of my early web development projects that I worked on at the beginning of my learning journey, and it's also my first **real client project**. I built it using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a website for a cottage rental in the Mazury region. I aimed for a clean and organized design. The website features several sections, including a gallery slider and expandable sections with additional information. It's fully responsive and follows the BEM methodology.
